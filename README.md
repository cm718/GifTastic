# GifTastic

## Create a dynamic page of cute animal gifs using the Giphy API.

### Click a preset button of a cute animal and watch the page fill with gifs. Or you can add a button of your own that will search the Giphy api.

Who doesn't love cute animals and gifs. This project brought both of these delightful things together. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have questions about the code or would like to reach out to me about working together.
